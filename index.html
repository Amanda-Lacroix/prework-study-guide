          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML Elements are case-sensitive. </li>
          <li>HTML Atributes define additional information about an element and always defined in the beginning element.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS  apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li> A link element is required in the HTML's head in order for the sytle sheet to apply.</li>

          <li>git commit -m : commits the changes with a commit message </li>
          <li>git pull: receives a branch's modifications into the local environment as defined by user. EX. git pull origin main : from the origin (Git Repo) from the branch (main). This ensures you have the most up-to-date code before making changes.</li>
          <li>git push: pushes the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch as defined by user. EX git push origin feature/starter-code</li>
          <li>Pull Request is used to merge a coparison branch (feature branch) into the base branch(main)</li>
